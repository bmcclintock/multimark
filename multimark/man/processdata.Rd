\usage{
processdata(Enc.Mat, data.type = "never", covs = data.frame(),
  known = integer())
}
\arguments{
\item{Enc.Mat}{A matrix of observed encounter histories with rows corresponding to individuals and columns corresponding to sampling occasions (ignored unless \code{mms=NULL}).}

\item{data.type}{Specifies the encounter history data type. All data types include non-detections (type 0 encounter), type 1 encounter (e.g., left-side), and type 2 encounters (e.g., right-side). When both type 1 and type 2 encounters occur for the same individual within a sampling occasion, these can either be "non-simultaneous" (type 3 encounter) or "simultaneous" (type 4 encounter). Three data types are currently permitted:

 \code{data.type="never"} indicates both type 1 and type 2 encounters are never observed for the same individual within a sampling occasion, and observed encounter histories therefore include only type 1 or type 2 encounters (e.g., only left- and right-sided photographs were collected). Observed encounter histories can consist of non-detections (0), type 1 encounters (1), and type 2 encounters (2). See \code{\link{bobcat}}. Latent encounter histories consist of non-detections (0), type 1 encounters (1), type 2 encounters (2), and type 3 encounters (3).

 \code{data.type="sometimes"} indicates both type 1 and type 2 encounters are sometimes observed (e.g., both-sided photographs are sometimes obtained, but not necessarily for all individuals). Observed encounter histories can consist of non-detections (0), type 1 encounters (1), type 2 encounters (2), type 3 encounters (3), and type 4 encounters (4). Type 3 encounters can only be observed when an individual has at least one type 4 encounter. Latent encounter histories consist of non-detections (0), type 1 encounters (1), type 2 encounters (2), type 3 encounters (3), and type 4 encounters (4).

 \code{data.type="always"} indicates both type 1 and type 2 encounters are always observed, but some encounter histories may still include only type 1 or type 2 encounters. Observed encounter histories can consist of non-detections (0), type 1 encounters (1), type 2 encounters (2), and type 4 encounters (4). Latent encounter histories consist of non-detections (0), type 1 encounters (1), type 2 encounters (2), and type 4 encounters (4).}

\item{covs}{A data frame of temporal covariates for detection probabilities (ignored unless \code{mms=NULL}). The number of rows in the data frame must equal the number of sampling occasions. Covariate names cannot be "time", "age", or "h"; these names are reserved for temporal, behavioral, and individual effects when specifying \code{mod.p} and \code{mod.phi}.}

\item{known}{Optional integer vector indicating whether the encounter history of an individual is known with certainty (i.e., the observed encounter history is the true encounter history). Encounter histories with at least one type 4 encounter are automatically assumed to be known, and \code{known} does not need to be specified unless there exist encounter histories that do not contain a type 4 encounter that happen to be known with certainty (e.g., from independent telemetry studies). If specified, \code{known = c(v_1,v_2,...,v_M)} must be a vector of length \code{M = nrow(Enc.Mat)} where \code{v_i = 1} if the encounter history for individual \code{i} is known (\code{v_i = 0} otherwise). Note that known all-zero encounter histories (e.g., `000') are ignored.}

\description{
This function generates an object of class \code{multimarksetup} that is required to fit `multimark' models.

# This example is excluded from testing to reduce package check time

#Generate object of class "multimarksetup"

#Run two parallel chains using the default model for bobcat data

#Run two parallel chains for bobcat data with temporal effects (i.e., mod.p=~time)
