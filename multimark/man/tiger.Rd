\title{Tiger data}
\format{These spatial capture-recapture data with a single mark type are summarized in a list of length 3 containing the following objects:

\code{Enc.Mat} is a 44 x (noccas*ntraps) matrix containing observed encounter histories for 44 tigers across \code{noccas=48} sampling occasions and \code{ntraps=120} traps.

\code{trapCoords} is a matrix of dimension \code{ntraps} x (2 + \code{noccas}) indicating the Cartesian coordinates and operating occasions for the traps, where rows correspond to trap, the first column the x-coordinate, and the second column the y-coordinate. The last \code{noccas} columns indicate whether or not the trap was operating on each of the occasions, where `1' indciates the trap was operating and `0' indicates the trap was not operating.

\code{studyArea} is a 3-column matrix containing the coordinates for the centroids of the contiguous grid of cells that define the study area and available habitat. Each row corresponds to a grid cell. The first 2 columns indicate the Cartesian x- and y-coordinate for the centroid of each grid cell, and the third column indicates whether the cell is available habitat (=1) or not (=0). The grid cells are 0.336 km^2 resolution. 

These data were obtained from the R package \code{SPACECAP} and modified by projecting onto a regular rectangular grid consisting of square grid cells (as is required by the spatial capture-recapture models in \code{multimark}).}
